# Data Structures

This repository contains various tutorials that I have worked through in order to increase my knowledge in Data Structures. Each branch represents the language in which the Data Structures have been implemented. 

> As not to ocupy too many repositories with "tutorials" I've decided to group them into a single repository by making use of the `git`'s `orphan` command - allowing you to have independent branches with their own independant `git` history. Further details can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/BenWolfaardt/50905fa3e10d73b3622a3148afffed09).

# Language Implementation

1. [C++](https://github.com/BenWolfaardt/Data_Structures/tree/01-C%2B%2B)
2. [Python](https://github.com/BenWolfaardt/Data_Structures/tree/02-Python)
3. [Go](https://github.com/BenWolfaardt/Data_Structures/tree/03-Go)
