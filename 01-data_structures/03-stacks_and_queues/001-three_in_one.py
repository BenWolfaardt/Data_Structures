#------------------------------------------------------Question------------------------------------------------------#

# Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

#--------------------------------------------------------Tips--------------------------------------------------------#

# 002 - A stack is simply a data structure in which the most recently added elements are
#       removed first. Can you simulate a single stack using an array? Remember that there are
#       many possible solutions, and there are tradeoffs of each.
# 012 - We could simulate three stacks in an array by just allocating the first third of the array to
#       the first stack, the second third to the second stack, and the final third to the third stack.
#       One might actually be much bigger than the others, though. Can we be more flexible
#       with the divisions?
# 038 - If you want to allow for flexible divisions, you can shift stacks around. Can you ensure
#       that all available capacity is used?
# 058 - Try thinking about the array as circular, such that the end of the array "wraps around"to
#       the start of the array.

#------------------------------------------------------Solution------------------------------------------------------#

# Like many problems, this one somewhat depends on how well we'd like to support these stacks. If we're
# okay with simply allocating a fixed amount of space for each stack, we can do that. This may mean though
# that one stack runs out of space, while the others are nearly empty.

# We can divide the array in three equal parts and allow the individual stack to grow in that limited space.
# Note: We will use the notation "[" to mean inclusive of an end point and "(" to mean exclusive of an end
# point.
 
#   For stack 1, we will use [ 0, n/3)
#   For stack 2, we will use [ n/3, 2n/3)
#   For stack 3, we will use [ 2n/3, n)

# If we had additional information about the expected usages of the stacks, then we could modify this algoÂ­
# rithm accordingly. For example, if we expected Stack 1 to have many more elements than Stack 2, we could
# allocate more space to Stack 1 and less space to Stack 2.

# Alternatively, we can be flexible in our space allocation, but this significantly increases the complexity of
# the problem.
